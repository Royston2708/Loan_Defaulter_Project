This was my first ever project in python, benchmarking perfomance of various machine learning and deep learning models on a loan defaulter prediction task. 
The code in models contains that code used to create these models. A lot of this repository also includes the exploratory data analysis and mini coding exercises I did to build familiarity with python.
